    Ruined Temple<br><br>
   
    Arriving at the temple (via spirits' secret path, or main path):<br><br>

    <a href="Elara' camp.html">Successfully retrieve the amulet: <br> 
        With the amulet in hand, Elara returns to her village, greeted as a hero. She uses its powers to heal the land and communicate with the spirits, bringing prosperity.</a><br><br>

    <a href="Elara' camp.html">Trigger a trap: <br>
         A floor tile sinks under her foot, and walls start closing in. Elara must find an escape route or use her gathered tools and knowledge to stop the trap.</a><br><br>
  
    <a href="Elara' camp.html">Leave the temple without the amulet: <br> 
        Realizing the risks are too great without more preparation, Elara decides to return home. She plans to gather more information and perhaps seek allies for another attempt.</a><br><br>
