    Arriving at the temple (via spirits' secret path, or main path):<br><br>
    
       <a href="option5A.html">Search for the amulet using the librarian's poem: <br>
        At the temple, Elara uses the poem as a guide, interpreting its riddles to uncover a stone altar. She presses the moon-shaped indent, and a hidden compartment opens, revealing the Whispering Amulet.</a><br><br>
 
       <a href="option5B.html">Use knowledge from your notes: <br>
           Elara recalls a passage about temple traps. She carefully avoids stepping on certain tiles and uses an old chant mentioned in her notes to deactivate a magical barrier, gaining safe access to the amulet.</a><br><br>
  
       <a href="option5C.html">Rely on instinct: <br>
           Trusting her gut, Elara explores the shadowy corners of the temple. Her intuition leads her directly to the amulet, though this risky path triggers a noise that echoes ominously through the ruins.</a><br><br>

 The architecture includes weathered stone columns and crumbling arches, enhanced with statues of mythical gods.
  The grand stone altar, adorned with ancient symbols and faintly glowing runes, stands prominently in the center, surrounded by scattered relics and offerings.
   This setting creates a deep sense of reverence and mystery, further enhanced by the dim light filtering through the stone, illuminating the altar and casting dramatic shadows" width="400px"/>
