       <a href="option5A.html">Search for the amulet using the librarian's poem: <br>
        At the temple, Elara uses the poem as a guide, interpreting its riddles to uncover a stone altar. She presses the moon-shaped indent, and a hidden compartment opens, revealing the Whispering Amulet.</a><br><br>
