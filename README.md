Comp 1004 coursework part 2

## Description
I have made this game using HTML and Javascript, the game is a short story about a girl name Elara who is essentially an archeolagist for lack of a better term. the story will go over her journey to discover an amulet long thought lost to the ages of her world Eldoria. I will also go over in depth and detail what i have done in my project but that will all be in the Microsoft word document.  

## Disclosure
i have used a GPT bot to generate custom images so that i could further add into the roleplay of this project as well as for some reference guides to further help me delve into the Fantsay aspect of this game.

## Disclosure
I started this project quite late as i had some personal problems the last few months and had meeting with tutors and they helped guide me through this project. There will be some things missing from this project but i have done as much as i know for this project and hope that this will be succesful.
